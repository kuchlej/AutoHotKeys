List of commands:

ctrl + alt + c = Open calculator. If open it jumps to the Calculator app.

ctrl + alt + d = Send a datestamp to the current window.

ctrl + alt + l = Jump to a window called Left!

ctrl + alt + m = I created this for the meeting so I could jump back to the meeting window quickly. This will continue to work as long as the meetings say "meeting" in their title. Meeting hosts at the company seem to do everything not to have meeting in the title.

ctrl + alt + n = Opens my OneNote: It first checks to see if a specific oneNote is open to jump to in my list. If it fails to find that one it checks for one more then if that notebook isn't open it checks for any onenote being open, if that fails it opens a new instance of OneNote.
